# Rarible Protocol's JavaScript SDK Interface
### An easy-to-use interface that allows LazyMint, Buying, Selling, Bidding and relevant methods from the [Protocol Flow](https://docs.rarible.com/#protocol-flow). 
Rarible Protocol  Interface

> Disclaimer: This is still a Work in progress, and no logic has yet been developed for the SDK. This interface will serve as a cornerstone to integrate with the functions relevant to end users / developers of the Rarible ecosystem. 

## Overview

With `todo-name:RaribleSDK.js`, you can mint, buy, sell, and bid on NFTs on Ethereum (ERC-721 and ERC-1155) by accessing the most versatile functions of the Rarible Protocol. This allows developers like you to quickly iterate and build solutions for their specific use cases.

This interface aims to cover the entire [Protocol Flow](https://docs.rarible.com/#protocol-flow). 

*TODO: Verify these are the right methods that we're exposing*
1. Creating ERC721/1155 Asset Metadata and Calling the Mint function
2. Asset Discovery
3. Creating a sell order
4. Accepting a buyer/bid order
5. Order Discovery
6. Matching Order
7. Updating/Canceling An Order
